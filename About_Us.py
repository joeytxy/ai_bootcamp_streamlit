st.markdown('''
Develop a Streamlit application with two use cases:

- **Answer User Queries**: Provide tailored responses to user questions related to HDB resale properties, personalized to their profiles.

- **Insights and Visualizations**: Offer easily understandable insights and visualizations (when applicable) using historical data on HDB resale property transactions, based on user queries.
''')

st.subheader("Objective")
st.write('''
The main goal of this application is to enhance the flat selection experience for buyers.

Currently, resale property buyers often need to conduct extensive research across multiple websites to understand the steps and details involved in purchasing a resale unit. They frequently encounter jargon and terminology specific to the HDB resale context, which may require further research to comprehend. 
Additionally, the information available online is often generic and difficult to relate to individual profiles.

Once buyers decide on a unit, negotiating prices becomes crucial. However, information about past HDB resale transactions is often limited on listings, and available datasets on past transactions can be hard to analyse and understand.

Hence, this application aims to bridge these gaps by addressing both use cases outlined in the project scope within a single website.
